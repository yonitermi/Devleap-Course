=== Log file stats ===
In order to track server health we are required to issue a simple report from the server log files, a count of the number responses given of every status.
Write a program that accepts a logfile name, scans it and returns an ordered (by number) list of response statuses and their count, for example:
main("example.log") should retrun [(200,2),(404,1),(500,1)]

You can assume:
- The logfile structure is the same as given in example.log. Use common sense.
