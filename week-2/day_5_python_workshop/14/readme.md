## Bake a cake 
You just got from your best friend a recipe for a cake.
But unfortunately, you are not sure about the available ingredients in your kitchen.

Write a program which takes 2 parameters (recipe, available_ingredients), and returns the maximum number of cakes you can bake (integer). 
Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

### Example:
```py 
main({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200})
```
Should return ``2``
