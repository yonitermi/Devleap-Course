Write a function main(sentence) that takes a string as a parameter and 
returns the longest word in the string. If there are two or more words that 
are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. 

Some assumptions you can make:
- A word can contain any character
- Words are seperated by whitespace or the punctuation marks ,.;:'"(){}
- Sentence will not be empty of words - it will have at least one word

for example "Hello world" should return "Hello"
