=== Generating mail addresses ===
Write a script that 
  - accepts a string of comma delimited names 
  and 
  - returns a list of tuples, each with the original name and generated e-mail following several rules

For example the list "John doe,Jane McDun" 
will return [("John doe","john.doe@company.com"), ("Jane McDun", "jane.mcdan@company.com")]

Here are the rules for mail generation:
(a) Mail is <first-name>.<last-name>. Other parts of name should not be part of mail
(b) If name contains non-alpha characters (e.g. dan ben-shabat), they should be removed from mail address (e.g. dan.benshabat)
(c) Domain is company.com
(d) Mails are lower case
(e) mails must be unique. If several people get same mail, then the first will get 
    the original mail and all other people this specific mail will get a counter starting at 2
    e.g. moshe.cohen2@company.com, moshe.cohen3@company.com etc.
(f) List must be ordered like the original input
Note: When returning the list, the name part must be EXACTLY as passed though stripped of enclosing spaces.

Assumptions:
(1) You can assume that names always have _at_least_ first and last name
(2) You can assume no special characters in names - just alpha, comma, period, spaces and dashes.
