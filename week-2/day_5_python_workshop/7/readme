Write main(word,parts) which accepts two strings:
- a word (composed of only english characters)
- a comma separated string of 'parts'
for example: ("hellocat", "apple,bat,cat,goodbye,hello,yellow,why"). 

Your goal is to determine if the word can be split into two parts from the list, and return them.

In this example, the first element can be split into two words: hello and cat 
because both of those words are in the parts string. 
Your program should return the two words that exist in the dictionary as an ordered list that 
can be used to build the word. Order should be according to word, not according to parts!
In our example: ["hello","cat"]

If there is no way to split string into two words that exist in parts, return an empty list.

You can assume:
1) both strings are never empty 
2) list string only contains english characters and commas
3) word string only contains english characters 
4) The word will never exist in the list as single part
5) There will only be one correct way to split the first element of characters into two words.
