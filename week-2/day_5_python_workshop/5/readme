Write the function main(seconds) which accepts any integer number of seconds and returns a string
which lists the number of hours, minutes and seconds it represents - seperate by a colon(:)
Note that the return value:
(1) Will always contain all 3 fields
(2) minutes and seconds must always be 2-digit
(3) will start with "-" for negative numbers, e.g. "-0:12:21"
You can safely assume that you will always be passed an integer.

For example: 
main(3723) will return "1:02:03"
