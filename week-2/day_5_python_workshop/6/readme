Write a function main(bigstr,smallstr) which accepts two strings and returns:
- True - if the second can be created by rearanging some/all of the characters in the first, e.g. ("nomad","and")
- False - if not, e.g. ("to do is to be","dodo")

You can assume that both string will not be empty a and contain ONLY english characters and spaces
