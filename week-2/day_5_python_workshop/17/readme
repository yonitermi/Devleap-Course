=== Mail extraction ===
Write a function getMails(txt) which recieves a block of text and returns a list of all mails 
found in that block. Note that list must contain unique e-mail addresses, 
i.e. same address will not appear twice.
For simplicity you can assume that e-mail addresses use only letters,numbers and '.' in both 
parts.
Important:
(1) Do not return same mail twice
(2) Mails are case-insensitive. dan@joe.com is the same as Dan@JOE.COM
(3) The returned list must be sorted by DOMAINS and then by Names, e.g. 
   ("chalie@microsoft.com", "nancy@microsoft.com", "dan@netex.co.il", "chris@yahoo.com")
(4) Returned mails must retain case of the first instance found

For example: the block
Hello, my name is Omri and my mail in omri.spector@develeap.com, 
 though I used to have a hotmail account ospector@altavista.com - but that was years ago.
 My partner is Dori, a.k.a dori.kafri@develeap.com
should return ["ospector@altavista.com","dori.kafri@develeap.com","omri.spector@develeap.com"]
