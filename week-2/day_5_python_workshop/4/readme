Write a function main(str) which accepts a string parameter and returns a similiar string 
with all of it's words properly Capitalized. 
Note that words can be separated by any white space, comma (,), semicolon(;) or period(.)
A word can contain ANY other character.

Capitalization rules:
(1) If the first character is english, it needs to be upper case
(2) Any english character that is NOT the first, needs to be lowercase

For example:
"I don't like this excercise" should turn into 
"I Don't Like This Excercise"
