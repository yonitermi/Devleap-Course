Your task is to write a program that parses a CSV file.

What is CSV?
CSV (Comma Separated Values) files is a plaintext format that stores rows of data, organized by columns (basicly a table).
For example:
"Name","Gender","Age"
"John","M","12"
"Sean","M","43"
"Victoria","F","39"
Note:
- The first line contains column titles.
- All values are in double-quotes and separated by commas.
Write a program in Python called "sum-columns.py" where you pass a CSV file name and a column number as arguments. The program should return the sum of values in the column.

Example usage:

sum-columns expenses.csv 3
Example output:

The total 'amount' is 5,384.2
The program will:

Open the CSV file. 
Go over all values in the column.
Print the sum of all the values, formatted nicely (see example above).
Make your code robust, so it will be able handle edge cases intelligently:
- Negative values; decimal (float) values.
- Columns with mixed values (integers and strings).
- Incomplete columns (with partial data).
A few CSV files with real data are attached. Please use them (and your own) to test.
